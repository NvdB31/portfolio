                <p>I love toying around with new ideas. I believe that the best way to find out the viability of an idea is to just... try it out! I often create a small prototype over the weekend â€“ and use that to demonstrate and ask for feedback.</p>
                <p>The following is a collection of some of these ideas. Most of them never turn out to be commercially successful, but that's not the point! It's my personal outlet for creativity and a way for me to keep learning and stay up to date with things.</p>
